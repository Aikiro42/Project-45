  "description" : "Adds moddable guns with Synthetik-esque mechanics into the game.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/Xj04TVY.png[/img]\n\nThe greatest minds of Letheia Corp. and The Miniknog Institute present to you: Project 45!\n\n[h1]How to Obtain[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Craft the \"Project 45 Gun Shop\" with the [b]fully upgraded Inventor's Table[/b].\n[*]Purchase the \"Project 45 Gun Shop\" from the Shipyard Captain for 10,000 pixels.\n[*]Random items can be obtained from opening the Gun Bag, sold in the shop for 20,000 pixels. You can replenish the number of times you can open the Gun Bag via applying Gun Bag Keys to it, also sold from the gun shop.\n[*]Items can randomly drop from enemies.\n[*]Items can randomly be offered as quest rewards.\n[/list]\n[b]All Project 45 related items can be purchased from the gun shop.[/b]\n\n[quote=Aikiro42]\n[h1]Disclaimer:[/h1]\nThe weapons of this mod have the potential to become [b]overpowered[/b], which may affect your gameplay experience.\n\n[i](The mod author has made attempts to balance the mod around endgame, but the nature of the mod's modding system and gunfire mechanics make it extremely difficult.)[/i]\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=Aikiro42]\n[h1]Warning:[/h1]\n[b]This mod was not designed for multiplayer use.[/b]\n\nShould you do otherwise, though, remember to back up your saves and provide feedback regarding the co-op/PvP performance of this mod.\n[/quote]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/617c7EM.png[/img]\n\nProject 45 features new weapons introducing new mechanics inspired from [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/528230/SYNTHETIK_Legion_Rising/]Synthetik[/url] and [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/230410/Warframe/]Warframe[/url], including but not limited to:\n\n[h2]Criticals:[/h2] \nProject 45 weapons can critically hit; critical hits with weapons that have more than 100% critical chance deal even more damage!\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/O2PoOxH.gif[/img]\n\n[h2]Firing Mechanics:[/h2]\nProject 45 weapons feature hitscans, beams, and bolt-action (and slam-fire) firing; now you'll have to think about your next shots before engaging the enemy!\n\n[h2]Recoil:[/h2]\nProject 45 weapons recoil when firing, and is affected by movement and whether you are crouching or standing.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/MdOVPaQ.gif[/img]\n\n[h2]Stat Bonuses:[/h2]\nProject 45 weapons spawn with a random [b]\"bonus ratio\"[/b] to their [b]base damage[/b], [b]base critical chance[/b] and [b]base critical damage multipliers[/b].\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/OecaFZv.png[/img]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/mHeiMS6.gif[/img]\n\nOne of the core mechanics of Project 45 weapons is the [b]Active Reload System[/b]. The weapons are ammo-based; reloading consumes some of your energy, and gives you an opportunity to boost your damage, or set yourself up for precarious moments.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/t2ePe0k.gif[/img]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/1yzB9tS.png[/img]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/HAXmipr.gif[/img]\n\nWhat sets these apart from vanilla is the ability to customize and improve them to maximize your damage output. Project 45 Weapons allow attachment, stats, projectile, and even ability modification, providing you ultimate freedom in the art of obliterating enemies.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/GO9bcaZ.gif[/img]\n\nMore information can be found in the in-mod [b]Project 45 Manual[/b] sold by the [b]Project 45 Gun Shop[/b] vending machine.\n\n[h1]Credits[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Nebulox[/b] for the gun sprites, weapon mod sprites, modding guidance, code snippets, art style and palette\n[*] [b]Silver Sokolova[/b] for testing, reviewing and providing feedback for the mod pre-release\n[*] [b]Raizzy[/b] for the Zweibrandyr and part of its palette\n[*] [b]Nitrosteel[/b], [b]Silver Sokolova[/b], [b]clay eater (patman)[/b], [b]Chofranc[/b] and the rest of #mod-dev for helping out with concepts and general modding guidance\n[*] [b]Nitrosteel[/b] for the Powerstave, and Typhon and its respective assets\n[*] [b]Nebulox and The [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2431875552]Starforge[/url] Team[/b] for references, borrowed assets and code snippets (homing bullet script and Magma Spitter and Flamethrower Oil Projectiles)\n[*] [b]Shift Up[/b], [b]Yager Development[/b], [b]SNK Corp.[/b], [b]Infinity Ward[/b], [b]Amazing Seasun Games[/b] for weapon concepts, game mechanic ideas and SFX and VFX assets\n[*] [b]Digital Extremes[/b] and [b]Flow Fire Games[/b] for game mechanic ideas\n[*] [b][url=https://freesound.org/]Freesound[/url][/b], [b][url=https://www.youtube.com/@mgwsounddesign4838]MGW Sound Design[/url][/b], [b][url=https://www.youtube.com/@TenaciousTrilobite]Tenacious Trilobyte[/url][/b], [b][url=https://www.youtube.com/@mishas_guns]Misha's Guns[/url][/b], [b][url=https://www.youtube.com/@GunsOfTheWorld]Guns of the World[/url][/b] and other gun youtubers for sound effects and references\n[/list]\n\n[quote=Aikiro42]\n\n[h1]Developer's Notes:[/h1]\n\nAfter developing this mod for over a year, I'm finally releasing it to the steam workshop. This has been long overdue, and I have yet to fix stuff in my prior mod, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2858362793]Project 42[/url].\n\nI'm finally listing this in the workshop because my progress on this mod has stagnated, and I determined that the best thing for me to do to improve this mod further is to receive feedback from the community. Particularly, I'm concerned how well my mod functions in low-end systems, and if there are any edge cases that I missed.\n\nI hope y'all enjoyed this mod. I put my heart and soul into its development, and I learnt a lot while developing this mod; I'm excited to apply what I've learned on updating my previous mods and creating new ones.\n\nCheck out the [url=https://github.com/Aikiro42/Project-45]Github page[/url]!\n[/quote]",
