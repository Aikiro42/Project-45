      "# ^#E2C344;Introduction^reset;\nProject 45 guns are different from vanilla guns in the following aspects:\n1. They have the ability to ^#D93A3A;crit^reset; (and supercrit beyond 100% chance).\n2. They are more ^#51BD3B;energy-efficient^reset; due to being ammo-based.\n3. They are ^#d29ce7;modifiable and upgradable^reset; on the fly.\n4. Some fire different kinds of projectiles.\n5. Most can be converted to fire other kinds of projectiles.\n\n",
      "# ^#E2C344;Weapon Stats^reset;\n- ^#95d1f3;Upgrade Capacity^reset;: The number of Stat Mods you can install on the weapon.\n- ^#EA9931;Damage per Shot^reset;: The range of damage a gun's (initial) projectiles will deal at 100% power multiplier, disregarding the target's defense.\n- ^#E2C344;Fire Time^reset;: the overall time it takes for the gun to fire a round.\n- ^#51BD3B;Reload Cost^reset;: the total percentage of energy required to reload a gun to its full capacity.\n\n",
      "# ^#E2C344;Weapon Stats^reset;\n- ^#cccccc;Reload Time^reset;: the maximum possible amount of time it takes to reload a gun to its full capacity.\n- ^#D93A3A;Crit Chance^reset;: the chance of the gun dealing increased damage. Odds beyond 100% give shots a chance to deal even more damage (i.e. a \"Supercrit\").\n- ^#D93A3A;Crit Damage^reset;: the number multiplied to the projectile's damage when it deals a super/crit.\n\n\n",
      "# ^#E2C344;Firing & Recoil^reset;\nProject 45 guns fire like any other gun, except they have a relatively predictable recoil.\n\nWhen firing, your gun's muzzle will kick up, and you will have to adjust your aim downward to counteract the recoil.\n\nTake a moment to steady your aim; ^#D93A3A;projectile direction is based on the angle of your gun^reset;.\n\n",
      "# ^#E2C344;Firing & Recoil^reset;\nThe amount of recoil is also affected by how much you're moving, whether you're walking, running or standing still.\n\nTo drastically reduce recoil, it is recommended to shoot while crouched. You could also modify your weapon with mods that reduce recoil.\n\n",
      "# ^#E2C344;Charged Weapons^reset;\nSome weapons require to be charged before being able to fire them, and some continue ^#96cbe7;overcharging^reset; to deal bonus damage.\n\nThe charge level of the weapon is indicated below the chamber indicator:\n\n- If the bar is ^#838383;gray^reset;, the weapon is charging and ^#D93A3A;cannot be triggered to fire^reset;.\n\n",

Projectiles fired by the weapon while the charge level is in this ^#96cbe7;deals up to 2x bonus damage^reset; at ^#D93A3A;full overcharge^reset;.\n- If the bar is lit up, the charge is ^#E2C344;perfect^reset;; Projectiles fired by the weapon during perfect charge ^#E2C344;deals at least 2x bonus damage^reset;.\n\n",
      "# ^#E2C344;Misc Stats^reset;\nThese stats are not necessarily shown in the weapon's tooltip, but affect the weapon's performance nonetheless.\n- ^#96cbe7;Multishot^reset;: Multiplier to the number of projectiles a weapon fires. Decimals are treated as odds that the gun fires an additional set of projectiles.\n- ^#f4988c;Heavy^reset;: Forces the wielder to walk while holding the weapon.\n- ^#f4988c;Recoil^reset;: Multiplier to the kick-up angle (and maximum recoil angle) of the gun when firing.\n\n",
      "# ^#E2C344;Misc Stats^reset;\n- ^#f4988c;Inaccuracy^reset;: Random movement of the arm as the weapon fires.\n- ^#f4988c;Spread^reset;: Natural deviation of bullets from their trajectory.\n- ^#9da8af;Trigger Time^reset;: Amount of time it takes before registering the next click. A factor of overall ^#E2C344;fire time^reset;.\n\n\n",
      "# ^#E2C344;Ammo & Reloading^reset;\nYou will have an indicator next to your crosshair showing the amount of ammo your weapon has.\n- If the indicator is ^#D93A3A;\"0\"^reset;, you will need to eject the magazine to reload. In this case, ^#EA9931;fire the gun to eject the magazine^reset;.\n- If the indicator is ^#D93A3A;\"E\"^reset;, the weapon has no magazine - you are ready to reload. ^#EA9931;Fire the gun to consume energy and begin reloading.^reset;\n\n",
      "# ^#E2C344;Ammo & Reloading^reset;\nWhen you begin reloading, a vertical bar with a colored section will appear in place of the ammo indicator, and a red line will move up along it.\n\n^#EA9931;Fire the weapon when the red line is over the colored region to execute an Active Reload, finishing the reloading process early.^reset;\n\nTake a moment to ready your aim after reloading; firing immediately can shoot projectiles off-target.\n\n",
      "# ^#E2C344;Reload Rating^reset;\nYour weapon's performance will change depending on whether you executed an Active Reload and whether you hit the colored regions:\n\n^#E2C344;PERFECT^reset; - Hitting the lighter-colored region gives your gun a ^#E2C344;1.3x damage bonus^reset; and ^#E2C344;completely prevents jamming^reset;\n\n^#60B8EA;GOOD^reset; - Hitting the darker-colored region gives your gun a ^#60B8EA;1.1x damage bonus^reset; and ^#60B8EA;completely prevents jamming^reset;.\n\n",

      "# ^#E2C344;Per-bullet Reload^reset;\nSome guns allow you to reload them on a per-bullet or per-clip basis. The \"reload rating\" of your gun (discussed in the previous section) depends on your \"reload score\" from reloading each (set of) bullets:\n\n- ^#E2C344;Perfect reloads are worth 2 points.^reset;\n- ^#60B8EA;Good reloads are worth 1 point.^reset;\n- ^#D93A3A;Bad reloads are worth 0 points.^reset;\n\n",

      "# ^#E2C344;Jamming^reset;\nSome guns have a chance to jam when firing, especially when reloaded badly. When they do, they fail to fire, and an orange jam bar appears beside the crosshair.\n\n^#EA9931;Press the fire button to deplenish the jam bar.^reset;\n\nYour gun will unjam and load the next round when the jam bar is empty.\n\n",
      "# ^#E2C344;Gun Modding^reset;\nModding weapons is similar to installing augments on EPPs. Whether you can install a mod on a weapon or not is largely dependent on their ^#d29ce7;Categories^reset;, ^#95d1f3;Upgrade Capacity^reset; and associated ^#9da8af;Mod Slots^reset;. For ammo mods, their ^#EA9931;Archetype^reset; also matters.\n\nIf a mod cannot be installed on a weapon, it will be indicated the next time you hold your weapon via red text that appears above the player character's head.\n\n",
      "# ^#E2C344;Stat Bonuses^reset;\nWeapons spawn with a seeded stat ^#96cbe7;bonus ratio^reset;.\n\nThe weapons can have\n- up to a ^#ea9931;+12%^reset; bonus to their base damage,\n- up to a ^#f4988c;+20%^reset; bonus to their base critical chance, and\n- up to a ^#d93a3a;+6%^reset; bonus to their base critical damage multiplier.\n\n",
