# v1.8.6b Hotfix
- Changed how properties of wildcard stat mods are preserved on application. Applying wildcards now add the `augment` config to the weapon instance's parameters. (Somehow, despite preserving the seed, wildcards regenerate different stats on the weapon's disassembly. Need to look into this further.)
- Decreased chance of stat mods dropping from 100% to 30% in T3 environments and under.
