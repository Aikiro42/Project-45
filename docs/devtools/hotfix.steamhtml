[h1]v1.8.6b Hotfix[/h1]

[list]
    [*]Changed how properties of wildcard stat mods are preserved on application. Applying wildcards now add the [code]augment[/code] config to the weapon instance's parameters. (Somehow, despite preserving the seed, wildcards regenerate different stats on the weapon's disassembly. Need to look into this further.)
    [*]Decreased chance of stat mods dropping from 100% to 30% in T3 environments and under.
