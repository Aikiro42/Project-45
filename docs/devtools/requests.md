## Bugs
- [ ] for some reason while im on a planet the ui element for reloading and ammo disapears, its only visible in the ship/outpost/other premade instances - seby marx
- [ ] I am not sure which mod is causing it (and i thought it was Mech Detailist causing the issue for the longest of times), but for some reason, the ammo counter and reload bar aren't showing up. nothing seems to show up in the logs to indicate why. - licflagg
- [ ] I have noticed that if I apply the Essential Gun Oil on one of the weapons and try to upgrade it, the weapon disappears forever, no upgrades and down a good gun. I am currently running a Frackin Universe playthrough this time around, I was able to upgrade prior to getting FU. Not surprising considering FU tends not to play nice with other mods. So just a heads up Aikiro42! - Trogdude
  - [x] With FU installed I found out that the Protector Rifle is not craftable. I had to go into admin to get it.
- [ ] Are upgrades for the guns supposed to be this common? It's not rare for me to get multiple from a single monster kill. - Pancakes and Syrup
- [ ] excuse me, should the damage multiplier or buffs work for weapons in this mod? i found the rage buff of Fleetly Fading didnt work for itself.

## Docs
- [ ] Add in-game documentation for some features
  - "Hey, sorry if it has been asked already, but how exactly do I use the transponder and supply drop? When a crate drops, how do I open it or use it?" 
- [ ] Clarify damage scaling
  - The "Damage Scaling" option seems a little misleading. I thought it was just it not using damage multipliers was just a straight up bug. Maybe renaming the option or adding a description to it would help? Something like "Characters Damage Multiplier Applied to P45 Weapons"?
- [ ] This isn't a feature request for the mod itself, but rather for the mod page. It would be nice if there were a list of weapons and where to acquire them that would be updated whenever new weapons were added. For example. The Protector gun is part of this mod, but does not seem to be available from the Project 45 Gun Shop, but rather the vanilla anvil/replicator. - AtomicBeaverCleaver
- [ ] May I please have a guide on what the 6 slots on a gun's upgrades each do? a picture detailing which bits are what would be most appreciated! - Carl
- [ ] Hello, How do i increase weapon Stat Bonus (in anyway)? - CursedJoys
- [ ] So i tested the mod in Multiplayer. it worked fine, but is there any way to make your teammate not taking damage from your rockets and explosion from weapons? - Юрий Цеванов
- [ ] Can weapons be manually reloaded? It's a nuisance to fire every shot left just to prepare for the next encounter. I can't seem to find any shortcut from the mod desc., the in-game manual, the controls options screen or trying different button combos. If they can't, I'd like to request it as a feature since it'd be redundant to fling it into the Feature Requests discussion forum. - Moq-Rubiaac; MadCat

## New stuff
- Stat Limitations
  - "Some weapon stats what player can customize, but they allow player only to add limitations, max ammo, max multishoot etc" - joon208
- [ ] Add feature to increase stat bonus: "I think a weapon synthesis feature is needed to increase the panel percentage." - 王源，中门封个烟
  - "A way to spawn in/get a weapon with certain bonus stat ratio would be nice." - koyuki virus
- [ ] Napalm (Ammo type: Gas): Reduced on-hit damage but burn every 1/2 second instead of every second, and spawns flames where it lands which stick around and burn for 5 seconds. (Basically turns the flamethrower into an area-denial weapon) - Rylasasin
- [ ] Guided (Ammo type: Rocket): Rocket will home in towards your cursor. (I honestly prefer this over homing rockets) - Rylasasin
- [ ] Proximity mine (Ammo Type: Grenade shell): Grenades will stick to where they are shot and explode on proximity after a 1 second arming timer. indiscriminate!! - Rylasasin
- [ ] Mining bomb (Ammo type: Grenade shell): Grenades do very little damage to enemies but destroy frontal blocks, allowing for quick and messy mining. - Rylasasin
- [ ] Rail Light (Slot: Rail) light that's always on that you can stick on a rail slot. Basically an alternative to the laser sight. - Rylasasin
- [ ] Fanning ('Stock', Revolver) converts the revolver into a 2-handed weapon where you 'fan' the action. Halves fire time and decreases loading time (if no speedloader present) - Rylasasin
- [ ] Titanfall Smart Pistol
  - "♥♥♥♥ it can we get the smart pistol from titanfall?" - Orifan1
- under barrel flare launcher and drill, because why not

## AtomicBeaverCleaver
This is one of my favorite mods on the workshop and it always has a place in my load order. Some things I'd be interested in potentially seeing: (Brace yourself, there's a lot XD)

- The ability to remap secondary-fire or abilities to shift or shift+right/left click would be very nice. Particularly for people like myself who prefer to install the mod that allows for right click reloading.

- Things from the recent Doom games (2016 and Eternal) like the Super Shotgun and Combat Shotgun from Eternal (or at least mods like the ones on the Combat Shotgun from Eternal, the rotary barrels and a sticky grenade launcher), the Gauss Cannon from 2016 (I know there's already a Gauss Rifle in the mod, and it's cool, but the Gauss Cannon from 2016 was really cool and satisfying), a minigun mod like the turret mod from 2016 and Eternal, the Ballista from Eternal, The Heavy Assault RIfle/Heavy Cannon from 2016/Eternal (Mods include a Precision Bolt mode (semi-auto shot with higher damage and accuracy) and Micro-Missiles (small missiles that fire quickly and stick to a target before exploding), I enjoyed the Rocket Launchers from both 2016 and Eternal, a Chainsaw, and the Crucible blade..

- The Firestorm Revolver from Rage 2. It's a revolver that fires explosive incendiary rounds. In normal mode, they stick to enemies and detonate when using the secondary fire. In overdrive mode the revolver just straight up shoots fireballs.
- A Multiple Missile Launcher, the one from Rage 2 is a great example.
- The Nail Gun from the first Rage game. It starts out as a nail firing SMG, but can be upgraded to have a sniper mode that fires pieces of rebar, and a railgun upgrade that increases the velocity of fire projectiles, allowing the rebar shots to do more damage, pierce cover, and pin enemies to surfaces after death. (I don't necessarily expect these last two features)
- Weapons from
  - (Rejected: Should be new mod; MA51 already present) Halo (Hydra MLRS and Railgun)
  - (Approved) Starcraft series (Starcraft Gauss Rifle and Canister Rifle)

- Maybe some weapons from the
  - (Approved) Mass Effect,
  - Killzone,
  - (Approved) Gears of War,
  - (Approved) Resistance: Fall of Man series,
  - (Approved) Dead Space,
  - (Rejected: Should be new mod) Warframe,
  - (Approved) Wolfenstein: The New Order & The New Colossus,
  - (Approved) Unreal franchise,
  - (Tentative: any unique guns?) STALKER,
  - (Approved) Quake franchise?

- (REJECT: Should be new mod) In general, more stuff from Cyberpunk 2077, and more weapon mods/ammo mods. Regarding Cyberpunk, the Smart SMG that's already in the mod is cool, but it's somewhat annoying that applying ammo mods causes it to lose its smart target tracking functionality. I can understand if that was intended for balance purposes, and if that's the case, I can also understand if you'd prefer to keep it that way. I'm also aware that there are now items available that allow us to apply vanilla elemental effects to weapons. However, please note that in Cyberpunk 2077 there are Smart Guns that fire explosive and even explosive-incendiary rounds.

Sorry for the massive wall of text and amount of suggestions. To be clear, I don't expect any of this, these are just things that are nice to have. Even ONE of these suggestions being added would be amazing, but I'm completely happy with you guys just doing your thing and making this already awesome mod even better.
