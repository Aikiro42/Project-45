[h2]User-side[/h2]

[h3]New Features[/h3]

[list]
    [*]Added "shift abilities", which is a separate implementation from PsyNy's Ability Extender. These abilities are either passive or activated by tapping the shift key.[quote]Technically they can be activated with right click depending on how they're coded. They're essentially secondary alt abilities.[/quote]


    [*]Added the [b]Gun Shield[/b], a passive regular variant of the A.R.M.D.L.O shield.
    [*]Added the [b]F.I.S.T. Gauntlet[/b], an experimental close-range punching weapon.
    [*]Added the [b]Wrist Gun[/b], a wrist-mounted pistol that can accept underbarrel mods.
    [*]Added [b]The Protector[/b], a hand-craftable and highly-modifiable weapon.
    [*]Added the [b]ElementoilÂ© Vanilla Flavour[/b], an applied utility that changes the weapon's elemental type into a random vanilla one. (Beyond improving compatibility with PsyNy's Retrofitting Station, it has no effect on the weapon.)
    [*]Added the [b]Choke[/b] mod for shotguns.
    [*]Added an explosive burst alt ability to the [b]Malorian Arms 3516[/b].
    [*]Added a custom alt ability to [b]Fleetly Fading[/b], "Scarlet Flash":[list]
    [*]Scarlet Flash shoots an initial "slash" projectile in the direction of the mouse, then distributes 10 slashes among nearby enemies.
    [*]Its damage is calculated as such: [code]AD (ability damage) = baseDamage * reloadRatingMult * stockAmmoMult * passiveDamageMult * critDamage{reloadRating} * healthMult[/code]
    [*]If Scarlet Flash is not used with Project 45 weapons, it scales off energy instead.
[/list]
    [*][b]If you have StarExtensions or OpenStarbound, you can now reload your weapons with the "V" key![/b] You can rebind this key by typing '/binds' in the chat.
[/list][h3]General Changes[/h3]

    [*]Added a separate pane for a weapon's technical properties.

    [*]Improved the description of each weapon.
    [*]Improved the way categories are conveyed:[list]
    [*]All weapons now state their respective category as-is. ("Universal", "Ballistic", "Energy", "Experimental", "Special")
    [*]Special and Experimental weapons (that are actually Ballistic/Energy weapons) have a different flair to their categories.
[/list]
    [*]Renamed "Enemy Radar Mod" to "[b]Enemy Radar[/b]", and changed it to a shift ability mod
    [*]Changed [b]Shift Reload[/b] to a shift ability mod
    [*]Improved ammo mods: they should now apply an elemental type on the weapon.

    [*]Removed cheat code from the A.R.M.D.L.O Shield.
    [*]Decreased spread of the [b]Kuva Bramma[/b].
