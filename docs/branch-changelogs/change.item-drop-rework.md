# Changes
- Reworked item drops so that they drop in the form of cases and unknown stat mods, instead of themselves, so that gathering them won't result in a cluttered inventory. XSSR stat mods still drop as themselves.
- Decreased the weight of the max level mod.
- Increased the weight of the SSR Wildcard mod.
- Made stat drops more consistent:
  - for planet difficulties 0-1, there is a 6% chance to drop a tier 1 unknown stat mod, and a 4% chance to either drop a level mod or a Beginner's Crutch.
  - for planet difficulties 2-3, there is a 3% chance to drop a tier 2 (diff. 2) unknown stat mod and a 1% chance to drop a level mod.
  - for planet difficulties 4-5, there is a 1% chance to drop a tier 3 unknown stat mod, or a level mod.
  - for planet difficulty 6, there is a 0.5% chance to drop either ONE tier 3 unknown stat mod or a level mod.
  - for planet difficulty 7 and beyond, there is a 0.5% chance to drop either ONE tier 3 unknown stat mod or a XSSR mod (i.e. either a god mod or an admin mod).
- moved level mod drop to respective unknown stat mod drop tables
- fixed bad weights
