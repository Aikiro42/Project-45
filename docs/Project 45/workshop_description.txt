Project 45 features new weapons introducing new mechanics inspired from [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/528230/SYNTHETIK_Legion_Rising/]Synthetik[/url] and [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/230410/Warframe/]Warframe[/url], including but not limited to:

[h2]Criticals:[/h2] 
Project 45 weapons can critically hit; critical hits with weapons that have more than 100% critical chance deal even more damage!

[h2]Firing Mechanics:[/h2]
Project 45 weapons feature hitscans, beams, and bolt-action (and slam-fire) firing; now you'll have to think about your next shots before engaging the enemy!

One of the core mechanics of Project 45 weapons is the [b]Active Reload System[/b]. The weapons are ammo-based; reloading consumes some of your energy, and gives you an opportunity to boost your damage, or set yourself up for precarious moments.

What sets these apart from vanilla is the ability to customize and improve them to maximize your damage output. Project 45 Weapons allow attachment, stats, projectile, and even ability modification, providing you ultimate freedom in the art of obliterating enemies.

[h1]Developer's Notes:[/h1]

After developing this mod for over a year, I'm finally releasing it to the steam workshop. This has been long overdue, and I have yet to fix stuff in my prior mod, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2858362793]Project 42[/url].

I'm finally listing this in the workshop because my progress on this mod has stagnated, and I determined that the best thing for me to do to improve this mod further is to receive feedback from the community. Particularly, I'm concerned how well my mod functions in low-end systems, and if there are any edge cases that I missed.

I hope y'all enjoyed this mod. I put my heart and soul into its development, and I learnt a lot while developing this mod; I'm excited to apply what I've learned on updating my previous mods and creating new ones.
