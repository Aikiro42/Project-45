- [ ] `DefinitelyNotScythe`: Been testing out the weapons, I agree with JamesonMdragon, the mechanics are incredibly fun and the sound / visual designs are great, but I'd say some hard limits need to be implemented on varying damage stats or at the very least tone the damage down quite a bit on the higher end guns. Right now a high end gun with a decent mod setup can completely outclass the end game mods from most of the big gun mods, shellguard, knightfall, FU, etc.

- [ ] JamesonMdrago: Balance early/mid game guns

- [ ] JamesonMdrago: Balance high firerate guns

- [ ] DefinitelyNotScythe: Balance around popula gun mods e.g. shellguard, knightfall, unbound; implement range limits on damage stats?

- [ ] DefinitelyNotScythe: Easy to gain high damage with the pistol

- [x] ~~Work_In_Progress: Great mod, but saying that it's breaking balance is an understatement, most of it is probably intentional but one thing that stood out for me is how mush money some wildcard mods can be sold for, in range from 200 to millions of pixels, which easily lets you get just stupid amounts of money.~~

- [x] ~~JamesonMdrago: This is ontop of the fact that humanoid enemies drop so many guns and gun mods that it absolutely floods your inventory in a single visit.~~

- [x] ~~DefinitelyNotScythe: (Regarding wildcard mods) One of them was 1389731840 pixels, and another I found had a value so high it caused an overflow and would result in -237832423462138761... too much to show up on screen lmao~~
