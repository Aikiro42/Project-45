- [ ] Whym: The Zwebyander can corrupt and cause a crash loop when holding it if you buff it too much? Works fine on singleplayer, but on multiplayer it will kick you to the main menu. Was messing around and put all god mods on it and the moment I clicked it kicked out. Only fixed it by quickly swapping to a different item in my hotbar (and later figured out you can just go into singleplayer and remove it before it breaks things)

- [ ] Whym: I also think god mods, all the stats are just missing (or have an extra digit?) In multiplayer

- [ ] Orifan1, Whym: i gave the tinnitus pistol to a crewmate and now i can see where they are aiming. due to the ammo readout. Same thing with other players.

- [ ] Whym: Clicking the Mods menu in the shop will then cause all other menus in the vending machine to display the manual reload and only the manual reload in every tab. Simply avoiding the mods menu is fine, its only after clicking into mods that it happens and the bug corrects itself if you close and reopen the vending machine window, but the mods menu remains broken in multiplayer.
