# ^#E2C344;Introduction^reset;
Project 45 guns are different from vanilla guns in the following aspects:
1. They have the ability to ^#D93A3A;crit^reset; (and supercrit beyond 100% chance).
2. They are more ^#51BD3B;energy-efficient^reset; due to being ammo-based.
3. They are ^#d29ce7;modifiable and upgradable^reset; on the fly.
4. Some fire different kinds of projectiles.
5. Most can be converted to fire other kinds of projectiles.

# ^#E2C344;Weapon Stats^reset;

^#95d1f3;Upgrade Capacity^reset;: The number of Stat Mods you can install on the weapon.

^#EA9931;Damage per Shot^reset;: The range of damage a gun's (initial) projectiles will deal at 100% power multiplier, disregarding the target's defense.

^#E2C344;Fire Rate^reset;: the time it takes for the gun to cycle and fire a round.

^#51BD3B;Reload Cost^reset;: the total percentage of energy required to reload a gun to its full capacity.

Reload Time: the maximum possible amount of time it takes to reload a gun to its full capacity.

^#D93A3A;Crit Chance^reset;: the chance of the gun dealing increased damage. Odds beyond 100% give shots a chance to deal even more damage.

^#D93A3A;Crit Damage^reset;: the number multiplied to the projectile's damage if the gun would deal increased damage.

# ^#E2C344;Firing & Recoil^reset;

Project 45 guns fire like any other gun, except they have a relatively predictable recoil. When firing, your gun's muzzle will kick up, and you will have to adjust your aim downward to counteract the recoil.
    
The amount of recoil is also affected by how much you're moving, whether you're walking, running or standing still. To drastically reduce recoil, it is recommended to shoot while crouched. You could also modify your weapon with mods that reduce recoil.

# ^#E2C344;Ammo & Reloading^reset;

You will have an indicator next to your crosshair showing the amount of ammo your weapon has.

- If the indicator is ^#D93A3A;\"0\"^reset;, you will need to eject the magazine to reload. In this case, ^#EA9931;fire the gun to eject the magazine^reset;.

- If the indicator is ^#D93A3A;\"E\"^reset;, the weapon has no magazine - you are ready to reload. ^#EA9931;Fire the gun to consume energy and begin reloading.^reset;
    
^#D93A3A;Energy does not regenerate while you hold a WS45 gun, unless the gun is empty (i.e. the indicator is \"0\" or \"E\") and you are out of energy.^reset;

When you begin reloading, a vertical bar with a colored section will appear in place of the ammo indicator, and a red line will move up along it. ^#EA9931;Fire the weapon when the red line is over the colored region to execute an Active Reload, finishing the reloading process early.^reset;

### ^#E2C344;Reload Rating^reset;

Your weapon's performance will change depending on whether you executed an Active Reload and whether you hit the colored regions:

^#E2C344;PERFECT^reset; - Hitting the lighter-colored region gives your gun a ^#E2C344;1.3x damage bonus^reset; and ^#E2C344;completely prevents jamming^reset;
^#60B8EA;GOOD^reset; - Hitting the darker-colored region gives your gun a ^#60B8EA;1.1x damage bonus^reset; and ^#60B8EA;completely prevents jamming^reset;.
OK - Allowing the red line to reach the end of the bar will simply reload your gun.
^#D93A3A;BAD^reset; - Hitting the white region will ^#D93A3A;increase the chance of a gun jam happening^reset;

### ^#E2C344;Per-bullet Reload^reset;

Some guns allow you to reload them on a per-bullet or per-clip basis. The \"reload rating\" of your gun (discussed in the previous section) depends on your \"reload score\" from reloading each (set of) bullets:

- ^#E2C344;Perfect reloads are worth 2 points.^reset;
- ^#60B8EA;Good reloads are worth 1 point.^reset;
- ^#D93A3A;Bad reloads are worth 0 points.^reset;

Allowing the red line to reach the end of the bar will end the reload sequence, leaving your gun with the amount of ammo you ended up with. ^#EA9931;Your reload score will be evaluated at the end of the reload sequence:^reset;

- ^#E2C344;Perfect reloads are worth 2 points.^reset;
- ^#60B8EA;Good reloads are worth 1 point.^reset;
- ^#D93A3A;Bad reloads are worth 0 points^reset;.

## ^#E2C344;Jamming^reset;
Some guns have a chance to jam when firing, especially when reloaded badly. When they do, they fail to fire, and an orange jam bar appears beside the crosshair. ^#EA9931;Press the fire button to deplenish the jam bar.^reset; Your gun will unjam and load the next round when the jam bar is empty.

# ^#E2C344;Gun Modding^reset;
Modding weapons is similar to installing augments on EPPs. Whether you can install a mod on a weapon or not is largely dependent on both of their ^#d29ce7;Categories^reset; and associated ^#9da8af;Mod Slots^reset;. For ammo mods, their ^#EA9931;Archetype^reset; also matters. For stat mods, the weapon's remaining ^#95d1f3;Upgrade Capacity^reset; matters.

If a mod is incompatible with a weapon, it will be indicated the next time you hold your weapon via red text that appears above the player character's head.
