[h3]Bugfixes[/h3]

[h2]Mod-side:[/h2]


# 2024-02-13
## User-side:
- Decreased effect of walking (2x to 1.5x) and being mobile (4x to 2x) on recover time
- Decreased recoil (3 to 1.75 degrees) and inaccuracy ([0.75, 1.5, 3, 4] to [0.5, 1, 1.25, 1.5]) of pistol
- Added option to disable flashlights and lasers on the weapon when no magazine or reloading; option is enabled by default
- incorporated option effect to project45gunscope laser
- Implemented option effect on primary laser
- Corrected category and tags of some weapons (particularly assault and sniper rifles and unique weapons)
## Mod-side
- refactor project45flashlight code while incorporating option effect
- moved self.reloadTimer variable to self.weapon.reloadTimer so that alt abilities can access it
- removed comment in project45gunscope animation script
- removed stray printline statement

#2024-02-14
[h2]User-side:[/h2]
- Added expy of Pancor Jackhammer to gunshop and droptables
- Improved silenced firing sfx
[h2]Mod-side:[/h2]
- Changed gun repair kit category to be usable with bk3k's inventory mod

#2024-02-15
[h2]User-side:[/h2]
- Guns now spawn with random stat bonuses, particularly to their base damage, crit chance and crit damage.
- Added settings for maximum percent bonuses applied to gun stats, namely the base damage, critical chance and critical damage.
- The stat bonus ratio is generated once and consistently applied to stats. e.g. a gun with 60% bonus will get a 60% bonus to its damage, crit chance and crit damage based on the max random stat values specified in the general config.
- Added a 0.5x multiplier to the bonus received by guns bought from the gun shop
- To more easily determine better guns, the bonus is formatted added to the final description.
- Improved mod settings window
- Added option to disable arm frame animations. Arms default to their rotation frames when switching stances (e.g. cocking, holding, reloading). Added for species compatibility, since some species restructure arm framesheets or animations.
- Added wildcard stat mods to the npc droptables.
- Increased the chance of project 45 items dropping from enemies.
[h2]Mod-side:[/h2]
- Changed the disassembler code to accomodate the new features
- Changed gunshop code to accomodate the new features
- Changed buildscript code to accomodate the new features
- Made the gacha drop seeded items.

#2024-02-19
[h2]User-side:[/h2]

[h3]New features[/h3]
- Added the first passive mod, Shift Reload, which allows users to reload their weapons via shift while not taking up the ability mod slot.
- You can now execute active reloads via right click (manual) or crouch (shift) if you have either mod installed.
  - Updated descriptions of manual reload and shift reload mods in accordance with the change.

- Decreased weight of project 45 item enemy drop chance from 0.5 to 0.1.
  - Decreased enemy drop rolls from 2 to 1.
  - Removed guaranteed(?) wildcard stat mod drops from enemies.
- Changed drop category weight distributions. R's, SR's, SSR's and XSSR's now have a roughly equal chance of dropping either a gun, a gun mod or a stat mod.
- Changed weights of Uncommons and Legendaries in their respective drop tables; compared to Commons/Rares' drop weight of 1, items of these rarities now have a drop weight of 0.5.

# 2024-03-23 (v0.99.6.0)
[h2]User-side:[/h2]

[h3]New features[/h3]
- Implemented chargeDamageMult and perfectChargeDamageMult. Weapons can now have differing overcharge and perfect charge damage multipliers.
- Added specific charge damage and perfect charge damage multipliers to the following guns:
  - Compound Bow (1x overcharge, 2x perfect charge)
  - Gauss Rifle (2x overcharge)
  - Machine Gun (0.5x overcharge)
  - Rocket Launcher (1.25x overcharge)
  - Accelerator (1x overcharge) (i.e. no damage change when overcharged)
- Added stock ammo. Stock ammo is a way to preserve your energy during gunfights.
  - You can replenish your weapon's stocked ammo by applying the "Stock Ammo" applied utility to the respective weapon.
  - A weapon's stocked ammo serves as a substitute for energy when it comes to reloading.
  - You can now reload weapons while your energy is resource-locked, as long as the weapon has stocked ammo.
  - Reloading while the weapon's stocked ammo is less than the amount normally loaded per reload consumes all of the remaining stocked ammo and finishes the reload sequence.
  - Disassembling a weapon with stocked ammo yields a "Stock Ammo" item that gives the respective amount of leftover ammo (stocked + in magazine).
  - You can now eject your magazine while your energy is locked, given you've installed mods that (or use guns that) that allow you to eject your magazine.
