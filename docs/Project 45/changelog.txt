[h2]User-side:[/h2]
- Guns now spawn with random stat bonuses, particularly to their base damage, crit chance and crit damage.
- Added settings for maximum percent bonuses applied to gun stats, namely the base damage, critical chance and critical damage.

- Added a 0.5x multiplier to the bonus received by guns bought from the gun shop
- To more easily determine better guns, the bonus is formatted added to the final description.
- Improved mod settings window
